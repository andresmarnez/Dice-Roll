# Dungeons and Dragons Dice
 This program in Javascript was developed to substitute dice in real live. 
 In order to calculate the random number is used:
 
```sh
Math.random(); //To get the random number from 0 to NOT including 1.
Math.floor(); //To round the number down to the closest natural number.ยก
```
